# PHP Pet Store Exercise

The PHP Pet Store Exercise is a basic backend exercise that provides an initial structure for an online pet store.

## Description

The primary focus of this code is on building foundational PHP classes for managing products, categories, and customers. Please note that this exercise does not include a front-end interface and lacks complete e-commerce functionality.

The project includes classes for:

- Product: Represents pet-related items such as food, toys, and kennels.
- Category: Categorizes products into sections like Dogs or Cats.
- Customer: Models users who can be registered or guests, with the ability to calculate discounts and process payments.
- CreditCard: A basic class to check if a credit card is valid and not expired.
